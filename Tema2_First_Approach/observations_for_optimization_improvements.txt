What I have change to the code strictly for performance are the following:
- range -> xrange (Returns a generator that brings numbers in memory only on demand)
- Load the modules as needed - lazy way (May reduce peaks of memory usage)
- Multiple assignments

What was already implemented:
- List comprehension as an alternative more optimal to loops
